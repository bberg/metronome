    <!-- Deliberate Practice Method Section -->
    <section class="research-section">
        <h2>Deliberate Practice Method</h2>

        <p>The metronome is central to deliberate practice - the focused, goal-oriented approach that separates world-class performers from amateurs. Rather than mindless repetition, deliberate practice uses the metronome as a precision tool for building reliable motor programs.</p>

        <h3>Slow Practice: The Foundation</h3>
        <p>The most important practice technique is also the most underused: practicing slowly. When you practice at a tempo where you can execute perfectly, you build correct neural pathways. Fast, sloppy practice builds fast, sloppy habits.</p>

        <div class="key-findings">
            <h4><i class="ri-lightbulb-line"></i> The Slow Practice Protocol</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Start at 50-60% of your target tempo</li>
                <li>Every note should be perfectly placed, with ideal tone and technique</li>
                <li>If you make a mistake, slow down further</li>
                <li>Spend more time at slow tempos than fast ones</li>
                <li>Use this time to observe and refine every detail</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Incremental Tempo Increase</h3>
        <p>Once you can play perfectly at a given tempo, increase by only 2-4 BPM. This micro-progression allows your motor system to adapt without developing tension or errors. The Tempo Trainer feature automates this process.</p>

        <div class="application-grid">
            <div class="application-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-speed-up-line"></i> The 3x3 Rule</h4>
                <p>Play the passage perfectly three times in a row before increasing tempo. One mistake resets the count. This ensures genuine mastery at each tempo level before progression.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="application-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-arrow-go-back-line"></i> Strategic Backtracking</h4>
                <p>When you hit a speed wall, go back 10-15 BPM and focus on relaxation and efficiency. Often the barrier is tension, not capability. Build back up with awareness of what changed.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Chunking: Divide and Conquer</h3>
        <p>Break difficult passages into small chunks - typically 2-4 beats. Master each chunk at slow tempo before connecting them. This targeted approach is far more effective than repeatedly playing through long sections with errors.</p>

        <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-focus-2-line"></i> Isolation</h4>
                <p>Identify the specific beat or note transition causing trouble. Practice just that transition, with one beat before and after, until it becomes automatic.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-link"></i> Connection</h4>
                <p>Once chunks are solid, practice connecting them with overlapping beats. The transitions between chunks often need extra attention.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-stack-line"></i> Integration</h4>
                <p>Gradually combine chunks into larger sections. Always at slow tempo first, building back up to target speed with the full passage.</p>

    <!-- Tempo Mapping Section -->
    <section class="research-section">
        <h2>Tempo Mapping</h2>

        <h3>Analyzing Recordings</h3>
        <p>Professional musicians don't play in strict mechanical time - they use subtle tempo variations for musical expression. Tempo mapping involves analyzing recordings to understand these variations and make informed interpretive choices.</p>

        <div class="application-grid">
            <div class="application-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-headphone-line"></i> Tap-Along Analysis</h4>
                <p>Use tap tempo while listening to a recording to track the performer's tempo changes. Note where they push forward, pull back, or hold time. This reveals the underlying tempo structure of an interpretation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="application-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-bar-chart-line"></i> Tempo Graphing</h4>
                <p>Create a graph of tempo vs. time to visualize the phrasing structure. Professional recordings often show consistent patterns - accelerating through phrases, slowing at cadences.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Rubato Notation</h3>
        <p>When learning a piece, use the metronome to establish a baseline, then deliberately practice your intended tempo variations. This ensures that rubato sounds intentional rather than accidental - you're choosing to deviate from the beat, not failing to keep it.</p>

        <div class="key-findings">
            <h4><i class="ri-music-line"></i> Rubato Practice Sequence</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>First, learn the passage in strict time with metronome</li>
                <li>Decide where you want to push and pull</li>
                <li>Practice with metronome, consciously playing ahead or behind</li>
                <li>Finally, practice without metronome, maintaining your intended shape</li>
                <li>Record yourself to verify the rubato sounds intentional</li>

        <h3>Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS)</h3>
        <p>Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation is an evidence-based neurologic technique using rhythmic cues to improve motor function. The metronome provides a consistent, adjustable rhythmic stimulus that entrains movement patterns.</p>

                <p>For patients recovering from stroke, Parkinson's disease, or traumatic brain injury, walking to a metronome beat improves gait speed, stride length, and symmetry. The external rhythm provides a temporal template that bypasses damaged timing circuits.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start at patient's natural cadence</li>
                    <li>Gradually adjust toward target cadence</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Measure your natural cadence first</li>

        <h2>Public Speaking & Presentation</h2>

        <h3>Pacing and Breath Control</h3>
        <p>Effective public speaking requires controlled pacing. Speaking too fast loses the audience; too slow loses attention. A metronome can help speakers develop awareness and control of their delivery tempo.</p>

        <div class="key-findings">

                <li><strong>100-120 WPM:</strong> Slow for emphasis or complex material</li>

                <h4><i class="ri-lungs-line"></i> Breath Pacing</h4>
                <p>Set the metronome to 60-80 BPM and practice breathing with the beat. Inhale for 4 beats, exhale for 4 beats. This develops the diaphragmatic control essential for projected speech.</p>

        <h3>Emphasis Timing</h3>
