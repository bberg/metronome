Tap the button (or press 'T' on your keyboard) at least 3-4 times in steady rhythm. The metronome will calculate the average time between taps and set itself to that tempo.

Sixteenth notes give four clicks per beat ('1 e and a 2 e and a'). Triplets give three clicks per beat. Using subdivisions helps internalize the beat more deeply, improves timing accuracy, and helps you understand exactly where notes fall within each beat."

Also practice without it to develop your internal sense of time and musical expression. A good approach is to learn passages with the metronome, then turn it off to check if you can maintain the tempo independently. The goal is to internalize the beat, not to become dependent on external cues."

The tempo automatically increases throughout your practice session. This is useful for building speed safely - the gradual increase allows your muscles to adapt without developing tension or making errors that come from sudden tempo jumps."

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Muted beats</strong> is a training technique where the metronome periodically goes silent, forcing you to maintain tempo internally. The metronome plays for a set number of bars, then goes silent for a set number of bars, repeating this pattern.</p>
                <p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p>
                <p>1. Start with 4 bars click, 1 bar silent<br>
                2. As you improve, increase silent bars (4:2, 4:4, 4:8)<br>
                3. Goal: stay perfectly in time when the click returns</p>
                <p>This develops your <strong>internal clock</strong> - the ability to maintain tempo without external reference. It's how professional musicians develop rock-solid timing.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Yes, for practical purposes.</strong> Metronomely uses the Web Audio API, which provides sample-accurate timing. Any variations are measured in microseconds - far below the threshold of human perception.</p>
                <p>The main timing consideration is audio latency (the delay between when a sound is triggered and when you hear it). This is typically 10-50ms on modern devices - consistent enough that it doesn't affect practice.</p>
                <p>For professional recording with click tracks, dedicated hardware is sometimes preferred, but for practice purposes, the online metronome is more than accurate enough.</p>

                <p>Both have six eighth notes per measure, but they're felt differently:</p>
                <p><strong>3/4:</strong> Three quarter-note beats per measure. Counted "1-2-3, 1-2-3" with equal emphasis. Think of a waltz - the first beat is strong.</p>
                <p><strong>6/8:</strong> Six eighth-note beats, but usually felt as two groups of three. Counted "1-2-3-4-5-6" or "1-and-a-2-and-a" with emphasis on 1 and 4. Has a rolling, compound feel.</p>
                <p>In Metronomely, set time signature to 3/4 or 6/8 and listen to how the accents change the feel.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>An <strong>accent</strong> is a louder click on the first beat of each measure. It helps you hear where the measure begins, making it easier to keep your place in the music.</p>
                <p>The accent creates the sense of "downbeat" that organizes music into phrases. In 4/4, the accented beat 1 gives structure to the pattern.</p>
                <p>You can toggle the accent on or off in the settings. Some musicians prefer no accent when working on even, unaccented playing; others always use it for orientation.</p>

                <p><strong>Odd time signatures</strong> like 5/4 or 7/8 don't divide evenly into 2s or 3s, creating asymmetric feels:</p>
                <p><strong>5/4:</strong> Often felt as 3+2 or 2+3. Count "1-2-3-1-2" or "1-2-1-2-3"<br>
                <strong>7/8:</strong> Often felt as 2+2+3, 3+2+2, or 2+3+2. The grouping affects the feel.</p>
                <p><strong>Practice approach:</strong></p>
                <p>1. Start very slow (50-60 BPM)<br>
                2. Speak the grouping while clapping ("1-2-3-1-2")<br>
                3. Once comfortable, add your instrument<br>
                4. Gradually increase tempo</p>
                <p>Famous examples: "Take Five" (5/4), "Money" by Pink Floyd (7/4).</p>

                <p>You're practicing too fast if:</p>
                <p>- You're making mistakes (even small ones)<br>
                - Your body feels tense<br>
                - You can't hear every note clearly<br>
                - Your timing becomes inconsistent</p>
                <p>The upper limit of useful metronome practice is around <strong>200 BPM</strong> for most musicians. Above that, the clicks blur together. For very fast music, practice at half tempo with subdivisions.</p>
                <p>Remember: practicing slowly and correctly is always more valuable than practicing fast with errors.</p>
